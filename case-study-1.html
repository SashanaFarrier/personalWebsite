                        <h2>Challenges</h2>
                       <p>While building this application, these are some of the challenges I faced:</p> 
                       <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Hosting:</h4>
                                <p>This was my very first time publishing and hosting a .Net Core application so I had difficulties figuring out the steps I needed to take.</p>
                                <p>In Visual Studio, after doing my research and watching YouTube videos, I decided to follow the method of publishing the files to a folder and then upload said files to the hosting provider. After doing this, I expected the aspplication to run, but it didn't. After watching a YouTube video one morning, I realized the the person published their app while the application was running on IIS. I decided to do the same. I republished the application, reuploaded the files and it worked!</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Database integration:</h4>
                                <p>After publishing and uploading the application files to the hosting server, I had difficulties connecting the database to the hosting provider's database. Eventually I got to the point where I was able to connect to the hosting provider's database sever using SQL Server Management Studio; however, whenever I tried to update my database locally, I kept getting an error which took me quite some time to figure out. In the end I realized that my connection string did not have the correct info and that's what was causing the error. After fixing my connection string, I was able to get the database working.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Email Client:</h4>
                                <p>The process of setting up an email client using SMTP did not go as smoothly as I had hoped. After couple hours, I was able to get things working.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>  
                    </div>
                </div>
